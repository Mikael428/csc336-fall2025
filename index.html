    <h1 style="color:blue; text-align:center;">LIL DARKIE</h1>
    <p>This song was created by rapper Lil Darkie (styled as<i> LIL DARKIE</i>) and is a pretty good song about not selling out. It was released in late 2023, around the time I started listening to him in general. I started looking at different kinds of artists because of him as well.</p>

    <h1 style="color:black;text-align:center">Sonic The Hedgehog</h1>
    <p><i>Sonic Generations</i> is a great game that celebrates the history of the <i> Sonic the Hedgehog</i> franchise. Half of the levels within the game are <span style="color:lightblue">"2-D"</span> levels based on more classic games, and the other half are <span style="color:darkblue">"3-D"</span> levels based on more modern levels. It is pretty enjoyable to play, and has a lot references to the franchise as a whole including the songs that you can listen to in the record room and (only in the original version) you can play the original <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> game. </p>
