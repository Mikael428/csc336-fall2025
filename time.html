    <h1 style="background-color: white; color: black;">This is a Great Game!</h1>
    <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">This Game is great, but there are other ones you can go for, such as <i>Sonic Riders</i>,
    <i>Sonic Colors</i>, or you can just decide to spend your time doing things that actually matter, such as spending time with your friends and family, instead of 
wasting your precious time playing games "ALL OF THE TIME". Not like you can't play games at all, it is definitely good to have hobbies throughout life, but 
obviously, don't let any "thing" take over your life.</p>

    <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">I'd put my LinkedIn here but I don't feel like it.</p>

     <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">"Don't just sit there and waste your precious time. When you want to do something, do it right away. Do it when you can. It's the only way to live a life without regrets."</p>

     <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">"To live a life of power, you must have faith that what you believe is right, even if others tell you you're wrong. The first thing you must do to live a life of power is to find courage. You must be ready to reach beyond the boundaries of Time itself. And to do that, all you need is the will to take that first step...."</p>

     <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">"SONIC RACES THROUGH THE GREEN FIELDS.
THE SUN RACES THROUGH A BLUE SKY FILLED WITH CLOUDS.
THE WAYS OF HIS HEART ARE MUCH LIKE THE SUN. SONIC RUNS AND RESTS; THE SUN RISES AND RESTS.
DON'T GIVE UP ON THE SUN. DON'T MAKE THE SUN LAUGH AT YOU."
