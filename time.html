    <h1 style="background-color: white; color: black;">This is a Great Game!</h1>
    <p style="background-color: black; color: white;">This Game is great, but there are other ones you can go for, such as <i>Sonic Riders</i>,
    <i>Sonic Colors</i>, or you can just decide to spend your time doing things that actually matter, such as spending time with your friends and family, instead of 
wasting your precious time playing games "ALL OF THE TIME". Not like you can't play games at all, it is definitely good to have hobbies throughout life, but 
obviously, don't let any "thing" take over your life.</p>
