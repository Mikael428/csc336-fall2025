My project: https://csc336-fall2025-1-ytfc.onrender.com/Schedule

This project is supposed to be a simple website, where you get a home page, then get to see the schedule of events coming up (data retrival with GET /api/schedule) as well as (POST api/register), for the register page, which handles form submission and saves registration records to a local JSON file.

There are three "pages" in total. You can navigate using the router-header on the top of the page.

I used express, cors, body-parser, react, react-dom, vite and devDependencies (for tools).
